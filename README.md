# Hello Project on Internet Computer (ICP) Blockchain

![Internet Computer](https://example.com/icp_logo.png)

Welcome to the Hello Project! This project serves as a critical step in verifying system compatibility and ensuring the proper installation of prerequisites necessary for developing more complex decentralized applications (Dapps) on the Internet Computer (ICP) blockchain.

## Purpose

The primary objective of the Hello Project is to meticulously validate the system's compatibility and configuration for ICP blockchain development. By creating a simple Dapp and simulating it on a local ICP blockchain, we can confidently ascertain that all essential components are properly set up and ready for more intricate development tasks.

## Running the project locally

If you want to test your project locally, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Starts the replica, running in the background
dfx start --background

# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interface
dfx deploy
```

Once the job completes, your application will be available at `http://localhost:8000?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.

Additionally, if you are making frontend changes, you can start a development server with

```bash
npm start
```

Which will start a server at `http://localhost:8080`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 8000.

### Note on frontend environment variables

If you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make one of the following adjustments to ensure your project does not fetch the root key in production:

- set`NODE_ENV` to `production` if you are using Webpack
- use your own preferred method to replace `process.env.NODE_ENV` in the autogenerated declarations
- Write your own `createActor` constructor
